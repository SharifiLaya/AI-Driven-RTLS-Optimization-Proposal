# AI-Driven-RTLS-Optimization-Proposal
AI-Driven RTLS Optimization for Hospital Workflow Efficiency

📌 Project Overview

This repository contains an AI-driven Real-Time Location System (RTLS) optimization proposal aimed at improving hospital workflow efficiency, resource allocation, and patient care. Using IoT sensor data, this project analyzes movement patterns, identifies operational bottlenecks, and proposes data-driven interventions to optimize hospital operations.

🚀 Key Features & Insights

# Movement Analysis: Tracking patient, staff, and equipment movement to identify congestion points.
# Lost & IR-Assisted Event Detection: Understanding tracking reliability and navigation challenges.
# High-Traffic Zone Identification: Using heatmaps and clustering to optimize space utilization.
# Predictive Modeling: Forecasting high-traffic periods for better resource planning.
# AI-Powered Optimization: Implementing machine learning techniques to improve patient flow and operational efficiency.

📊 Dataset & Key Variables

This project analyzes IoT tracking data from hospitals, containing columns such as:

- moving: Whether an entity (patient, staff, equipment) is in motion.
- lost: Instances where an entity was temporarily untracked.
- irAssisted: Usage of infrared-based tracking for location accuracy.
- roomName & floorName: Identifying areas with high movement or tracking issues.
- timestamps: Analyzing peak activity hours and shift change patterns.

📈 Proposed Interventions

Based on movement analysis, the following strategies can improve hospital efficiency:
✅ Optimized Resource Allocation – Adjusting staff schedules based on real-time demand.
✅ Wayfinding Enhancements – Improving signage & navigation in high-lost areas.
✅ IoT-Based Dynamic Tracking – Enhancing real-time patient & staff monitoring.
✅ Predictive Modeling for High-Traffic Hours – Allocating resources proactively.

📊 Success Metrics

To measure the impact of the proposed interventions, we track:

Staff efficiency (response time, movement optimization)
Reduction in lost events (improved tracking & navigation)
Room utilization rates (better space management)
Operational improvements (reduced bottlenecks, wait times)
